Hi! I am Zhiwei. I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Philosophy at Peking University and currently a visiting student at MIT. I mostly write about philosophy of mind and philosophy of perception.<br><br>
I’m advised by <a href="https://phil.pku.edu.cn/szdw/szll/wgzxjys/274743.htm" class="custom-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2f4f6e;">Qilin Li</a> at Peking University and, during my visit at MIT, by <a href="http://www.alexbyrne.org" class="custom-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2f4f6e;">Alex Byrne</a>.<br><br>
I enjoy cooking, wandering aimlessly, cycling, exploring narrative cinema, and reading personal biographies. I'm also a fan of the band <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/twenty-one-pilots/349736311?l=zh-Hans-CN" class="custom-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2f4f6e;">Twenty One Pilots</a> and Hong Kong singer <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/%E8%AE%B8%E5%86%A0%E6%9D%B0/41642722?l=zh-Hans-CN" class="custom-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2f4f6e;">Sam Hui</a>.
